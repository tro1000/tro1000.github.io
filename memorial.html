    <p>Sylvia Quiles, 96, of Nashua, New Hampshire passed away peacefully on February 1, 2021. Born in Puerto Rico on February 2, 1924 she is the daughter of the late Carmelo and Providencia Camis.</p>
    
    <div class="w3-panel w3-leftbar w3-light-grey">
      <p>Sylvia grew up in Puerto Rico and New York and graduated from the Lydia F. Wadleigh Memorial High School, Hunter College, and the Latin American Institute. She worked as a Spanish-English secretary for a few years and then as an Assistant Export Traffic Manager for a steel company in Manhattan, NY. In 1966, she ended her work career to focus on her family and raise her two daughters. Once they began attending elementary school, Sylvia resumed working in the library of the Catholic school which her daughters attended and was able to walk to and from school with them, and pass their lunches to them as they came down the stairs.</p>
      <p>In her younger years, Sylvia loved to dance and spend time with friends. In July 1960, one of her friends introduced her to a “gem of a man”, Jorge Quiles; Sylvia and Jorge were married the following year in May 1961. Sylvia was a gifted pianist who won several awards and medals in classical music. She was also an avid reader and gardener. Sylvia loved to take pictures and was never without a camera in her purse which she would pull out at every family occasion. Her love of pictures and documenting family history is evident by the dozens of albums that occupy an entire closet in her home. Sylvia was an animal lover; her pets included canaries and dogs. Her dogs held a very special place in her heart. Her beloved Cairn terrier, Daisy, was never far away from Sylvia’s side, even in her final days.</p>

      <p>Sylvia was a devout Catholic, and a member of the St Aloysius of Gonzaga parish. She loved everything life had to offer, especially her family and friends, music and dance, photography, gardening, and animals. She will be missed dearly.</p>

      <p>Sylvia is survived by her loving and devoted husband, Jorge Quiles; daughter Leticia Quiles and her husband Michael von Dadelszen; daughter Irina Owens and her husband Daniel Paul Owens; grandchildren Stephen George Quiles Lowther and his wife Gabriel Carberry Lowther, Cameron Joseph Quiles Lowther and his wife Riva Foss, Alexandria Elizabeth Quiles Lowther, Taylor Ryan Owens, Marin Elisabeth Owens, and Cole Patrick Owens; step-grandchildren Tim von Dadelszen, Richard von Dadelszen, and Anna Price and their families; great-grandchild George Michael Quiles Lowther; brother Hector Camis; and many family members and friends.</p>

      <p class="w3-text-grey">

Our heartfelt and deepest condolences to Jorge, Letty, Irina and their families on the passing of their beloved Sylvia.

Our families had a very beautiful "sixty" years of sharing many special occasions together..As my sister-in-law, we had a few things in common....married to brothers and our weddings were five months apart in 1961..Our three daughters and her girls shared many childhood celebrations together as "cousins" usually do!..Not only did she leave many memories behind but she left many photos of most of our gatherings...We are all very grateful to her for them!..She was loved by all!..

Sylvia will forever remain in our hearts and minds!..May her soul Rest In Peace!..SHE IS "SAFELY HOME"!...

LOVE AND PRAYERS from Efrain, Carmen and cousins Debbie, Denise & Donna...</p><br>

      <h5>Marianne Fitzpatrick - February 5, 2021</h5>
      <p class="w3-text-grey">Sylvia always welcomed me into her home and treated me like family. She was kind and sweet and she was a wonderful cook. I treasured the afternoons when I would go home with Irina for lunch and eat all her delicious food. I hope she passed down all her recipes for the family to share. Xoxo</p><br>
